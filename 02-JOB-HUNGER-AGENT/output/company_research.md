- Own and build core payment services responsible for high-throughput (thousands of transactions/sec) and low-latency processing in **Go**  
- Design, implement, and tune distributed systems components (caching with Redis, service orchestration on Kubernetes, performance metrics via Prometheus, hosted on Google Cloud Platform)  
- Collaborate closely with product, operations, security, and other engineering teams on feature design, scalability, and reliability  
- Lead performance profiling and optimizations, contribute to architectural decisions, mentor junior engineers, and participate in on-call rotations for incident response  

# Likely Interview Topics

- Performance tuning, benchmarking, and profiling Go applications (pprof, tracing)  
- Payment processing workflows & PCI compliance considerations  
- Scalability challenges: consistency, fault tolerance, resiliency (circuit breakers, load balancing)  
- Observability and monitoring: Prometheus metrics, alerting, incident post-mortems  
- Kubernetes deployments, container orchestration, and cloud networking (GCP)  
- Data stores at scale: Redis usage patterns, caching strategies  
- Team collaboration: code reviews, agile processes, cross-functional communication

- “Can you share how success is measured for this role after the first 6–12 months?”  
- “How do you balance rapid feature delivery with maintaining platform stability and compliance (e.g., PCI DSS)?”  
- “What learning and career development opportunities does Adyen provide for senior engineers?”  
- “How do you gather and incorporate customer feedback into the evolution of the Payments Platform services?”
